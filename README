Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -g FILE.bam, --genome=FILE.bam
                        A bed file defining the genome (or transcriptiome) to
                        distribute reads across
  -r READS, --reads=READS
                        The aproximate number of reads to assign
  -p PEAK_SIZE, --peak_size=PEAK_SIZE
                        The size of peaks to create
  -n NUM_PEAKS, --num_peaks=NUM_PEAKS
                        The number of peaks to create
  -c PEAK_COEFF, --peak_coeff=PEAK_COEFF
                        Coefficent that increases the weight of peak
                        locations, higher value = more obvious peaks
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile=OUTFILE
                        a bed and bam file root for outputting results,
                        default:out
